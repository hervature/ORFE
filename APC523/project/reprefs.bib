@book{Carmichael1999,
abstract = {The book provides an introduction to the methods of quantum statistical mechanics used in quantum optics and their application to the quantum theories of the single-mode laser and optical bistability. The generalized representations of Drummond and Gardiner are discussed together with the more standard methods for deriving Fokker--Planck equations. Particular attention is given to the theory of optical bistability formulated in terms of the positive P-representation, and the theory of small bistable systems. This is a textbook at an advanced graduate level. It is intended as a bridge between an introductory discussion of the master equation method and problems of current research.},

@article{Burrage2001,
abstract = {In this paper we present the composite Euler method for the strong solution of stochastic differential equations driven by d-dimensional Wiener processes. This method is a combination of the semi-implicit Euler method and the implicit Euler method. At each step either the semi-implicit Euler method or the implicit Euler method is used in order to obtain better stability properties. We give criteria for selecting the semi-implicit Euler method or the implicit Euler method. For the linear test equation, the convergence properties of the composite Euler method depend on the criteria for selecting the methods. Numerical results suggest that the convergence properties of the composite Euler method applied to nonlinear SDEs is the same as those applied to linear equations. The stability properties of the composite Euler method are shown to be far superior to those of the Euler methods, and numerical results show that the composite Euler method is a very promising method. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Liu2016,
abstract = {In this paper, a stochastic linear theta (SLT) method is introduced and analyzed for neutral stochastic differential delay equations (NSDDEs). We give some conditions on neutral item, drift and diffusion coefficients, which admit that the diffusion coefficient can be highly nonlinear and does not necessarily satisfy a linear growth or global Lipschitz condition. It is proved that, for all positive stepsizes, the SLT method with $\theta$ ∈ [1/2, 1] is asymptotically mean stable and so is $\theta$ ∈ [0, 1/2) under a stronger assumption. Furthermore, we consider the split-step theta (SST) method and obtain a similar but better result. That is, the SST method with $\theta$ ∈ [1/2, 1] is exponentially mean stable and so is $\theta$ ∈ [0, 1/2). Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the efficiency of the obtained results.},

@article{Garcia-Alvarez2011,
abstract = {Three schemes, whose expressions are not too complex, are selected for the numerical integration of a system of stochastic differential equations in the Stratonovich interpretation: the integration methods of Heun, Milstein, and derivative-free Milstein. The strong (path-wise) convergence is studied for each method by comparing the final points after integrating with {\$}2{\^{}}n{\$} and {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}n-1{\}}{\$} time steps. We also compare the time that the computer takes to carry out the integration with each scheme. Putting both things together, we conclude that, at least for our system, the Heun method is by far the best performing one.},

@article{Drummond1991,
abstract = {A class of robust algorithms for the computer simulation of stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise is investigated. Excellent agreement is obtained with the known analytic behaviour of the Kubo oscillator in the white noise limit. The algorithms include a known first-order one-dimensional explicit method, as well as implicit methods of increased stability. A distinction is drawn between classes of stochastic differential equations depending on the type of spatial variation or curvature defined by the diffusion tensor. This allows greatly simplified numerical implementations of the new algorithms in certain cases. The results of different techniques are compared for the case of the Kubo oscillator, where a semi-implicit technique gives the greatest accuracy. {\textcopyright} 1991.},
